Aircraft performance planning essential (summer density altitude reaches 11,000 feet).",
    "planning_recommendation": "Ski season (Dec-March) extremely congested with 2x normal delays - avoid if possible or plan for significant waiting time. Summer (July-August) secondary peak with thunderstorm risk. Spring/Fall (April-May, Sept-Oct) best conditions but weather changeable. Always plan for significant alternate distances (67+ miles to Eagle). Verify aircraft performance for high density altitude summer conditions. Winter operations require de-icing procedures. Weather can restrict operations completely - maintain flexibility. Single runway means any emergency or weather event can cause closure. Contact tower before entering Roaring Fork Valley for mountain flying guidance."
