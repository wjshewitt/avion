**Key Characteristics:**
- Elevation: 171 feet
- 2 runways (4,500m primary + 1,838m secondary)
- 24/7 operations (no night curfew)
- Fire Category 9 equipment
- Desert environment with dust storm vulnerability

**Critical Risk Factors:**
- Dust storms peak March-May & Sept-Nov (visibility reductions to 500m)
- Extreme summer heat (40-50°C impacts runway performance)
- Slot-coordinated airport (IATA Level 2)
- Landing permits required (72-hour advance booking)
- CAT II/III capability essential for all operations

### 3. Singapore Seletar Airport (WSSL/XSP)
**Location:** Northeast Singapore  
**Classification:** General aviation hub with commercial turboprop services  
**Key Characteristics:**
- Elevation: 36 feet
- 1 runway (6,024 feet × 151 feet)
- Operating hours: 0700-2200 LT (2300-1400 UTC)
- Night curfew 2200-0700 LT (except emergency/medevac)
- Tropical rainforest climate

**Critical Risk Factors:**
- Extremely constrained airspace ("Fish Bowl" effect) - surrounded by military/restricted zones
- Single runway limits flexibility during diversions
- No instrument approaches available (visual circuits only)
- Monsoon seasons (May-Sept, Nov-Mar) drive weather disruptions
- Complex tropical weather patterns with afternoon thunderstorms
- Slot requirement anticipated as traffic increases

## Data Collection Methodology

### Research Approach
- Comprehensive web search across authoritative aviation sources
- Cross-referencing across multiple official regulatory databases
- Systematic documentation of all 14 required risk factor categories
- Source attribution for every data point

### Quality Assurance
- Schema compliance verification: All 14 categories present in each airport
- Data accuracy spot checks against multiple sources
- Elevation, runway specifications, operational hours verified
- Geographic specific validations (desert operations, tropical weather, GA congestion patterns)

### Geographic Coverage
- **North America:** US West Coast regional hub (240,000+ GA operations annually)
- **Middle East:** Strategic hub in UAE (24/7 operations, desert environment)
- **Southeast Asia:** Tropical GA airport with complex airspace constraints

## Key Findings by Airport Type

### General Aviation Hub (KVNY)
- **Primary Challenge:** Extreme traffic volume and congestion management
- **Weather:** Minimal impact - favorable Southern California climate
- **Crew Requirements:** Standard FAA commercial pilot certifications
- **Uniqueness:** World's busiest GA airport with efficient tower management despite volume

### International Desert Hub (OMDW)
- **Primary Challenge:** Dust storm weather vulnerability and extreme heat
- **Operational Advantage:** 24/7 operations enable cargo focus
- **Regulatory:** UAE slot coordination and landing permit requirements
- **Uniqueness:** Modern infrastructure designed for high-capacity operations in harsh climate

### Constrained Tropical GA Airport (WSSL)
- **Primary Challenge:** Extremely restricted airspace ("Fish Bowl" effect)
- **Weather Challenge:** Tropical monsoons with frequent afternoon thunderstorms
- **Operational Limitation:** Single runway with visual approaches only
- **Uniqueness:** Complex airspace coordination with military/restricted zones
