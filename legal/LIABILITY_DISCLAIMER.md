- Subject to coordinate system inaccuracies (WGS84 datum assumptions)

**Never rely on Avion for precise navigation or terrain avoidance.**

---

## 2. WEATHER INFORMATION DISCLAIMER

### 2.1 Weather Data Sources

Avion aggregates weather data from third-party APIs, including:

- **Aviation Weather Center (AWC)** — METAR, TAF, SIGMET
- **NOAA** — National Weather Service forecasts
- **CheckWX** — Private weather data aggregator
- **Other commercial weather APIs**

**WE DO NOT GENERATE WEATHER DATA.** We display information provided by third parties "as-is" without independent verification.

### 2.2 No Warranty of Accuracy or Timeliness

Weather information provided by Avion:

- **May be outdated** — Caching delays, API latency, or transmission errors may result in stale data
- **May be inaccurate** — Third-party data sources may contain errors, omissions, or formatting issues
- **May be incomplete** — Not all weather phenomena (icing, turbulence, wind shear) are captured in METAR/TAF
- **Is subject to rapid change** — Weather conditions can deteriorate rapidly and may not be reflected in cached data

**YOU MUST:**

- Verify all weather data with authoritative sources (Flight Service Station, DUATS, ForeFlight, official briefings)
- Obtain an official weather briefing per 14 CFR § 91.103 before flight
- Monitor real-time weather updates during flight operations
- Exercise pilot judgment and consider weather outside reported parameters

### 2.3 METAR and TAF Disclaimers

**METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report):**

- Represents conditions **at the time of observation** (may be 30–60 minutes old)
- Covers only the immediate airport vicinity (weather may vary along your route)
- Automated (AWOS/ASOS) stations may miss significant weather (e.g., distant thunderstorms)
- Human-observed METARs may include remarks (RMK) not captured in automated parsing

**TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast):**

- Is a **forecast**, not a guarantee — actual conditions may differ significantly
- Covers a 5-nautical-mile radius around the airport (not en-route conditions)
- May not include all TEMPO (temporary) or BECMG (becoming) groups in simplified displays
- Valid for 24–30 hours but may be amended or superseded

**DO NOT rely solely on METAR/TAF for flight decisions. Obtain a full weather briefing.**

### 2.4 Weather Risk Scoring

Avion's automated weather risk engine generates risk scores (Low, Moderate, High) based on:

- Visibility, ceiling, wind speed, and precipitation
- Proprietary algorithms (`lib/weather/riskEngine.ts`)
- User-defined or default risk thresholds

**Risk scores are guidance only and do NOT constitute operational decisions.** Risk assessments:

- Do not account for pilot experience, aircraft capabilities, or operational context
- May not detect hazards outside METAR/TAF parameters (e.g., microbursts, volcanic ash, severe icing)
- Are subject to algorithm limitations and may produce false positives or negatives

**Pilots must conduct independent weather analysis and risk assessment per 14 CFR § 91.103 and company operations manuals.**

### 2.5 SIGMET, AIRMET, and Convective Outlooks

If Avion displays SIGMETs (Significant Meteorological Information) or AIRMETs:

- Data may be delayed or incomplete
