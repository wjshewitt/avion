## Legal Protection Assessment

### Before UK Enhancements:
- ⚠️ US jurisdiction (Delaware) - unenforceable against UK users
- ⚠️ US arbitration clauses - invalid under UK Consumer Contracts Regulations
- ⚠️ Blanket liability exclusions - violated UCTA 1977
- ⚠️ Generic GDPR references - unclear UK vs. EU compliance
- ⚠️ Missing Consumer Rights Act 2015 protections
- ⚠️ No CAP 1753 cyber security requirements

**Risk Level:** MODERATE-HIGH for UK operations

### After UK Enhancements:
- ✅ England & Wales jurisdiction - fully enforceable
- ✅ UK court system and ADR - compliant with UK law
- ✅ UCTA-compliant liability limitations - legally defensible
- ✅ UK GDPR (not EU GDPR) - clear post-Brexit compliance
- ✅ Consumer Rights Act 2015 - full statutory protections
- ✅ CAP 1753 cyber requirements - comprehensive disclosure
- ✅ Flight management focus - clear ground-based use case

**Risk Level:** LOW for UK operations

## Flight Management Platform Clarification

**Key Enhancement:** All documents now clearly state:

### ✅ Avion is a **GROUND-BASED** tool for:
- Flight department personnel
- Dispatchers and schedulers
- Aviation operations managers
- Planning and coordination staff

### ❌ Avion is NOT for:
- In-cockpit pilot use during flight
- Primary navigation or flight operations
- Real-time decision-making without verification
- Direct pilot operational decision support

**Operational Model:**
```
Ground staff use Avion → Verify information → 
Communicate to pilots → Pilots review independently → 
Pilots make final decisions
```

This distinction is critical for UK liability as it:
- Reduces direct liability to pilots/flight crews
- Positions service as "management tool" not "flight instrument"
- Aligns with CAA expectations for non-certified software
- Clarifies that PIC responsibility remains with pilots (ANO 2016 Article 239)
