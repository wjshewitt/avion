## Executive Overview

This assessment provides structured risk factor data for three strategically important Western European business aviation airports, collected through authoritative European aviation sources including regulatory bodies, airport operators, and FBO networks. All 14 risk factor categories from the required schema have been comprehensively documented with current 2024-2025 operational data.

## Risk Ranking Summary

### Tier 1: Highest Operational Complexity
**LSGG (Geneva)**
- **Primary Challenges:** Alpine weather vulnerability, mandatory 5-day advance PPR booking (IFR), mandatory handling agents, effective night ban (06:00-22:00)
- **Key Advantage:** Reliable CAT IIIb capability for poor weather; very close alternate (Annemasse, 13 km)
- **Best For:** Winter operations requiring ILS capability; operations with advance planning capability
- **Cost Profile:** HIGH (mandatory handling, Swiss fees)

### Tier 2: High Complexity with Event-Based Volatility
**LFPB (Paris Le Bourget)**
- **Primary Challenges:** Night curfew (22:15-06:00), slot-controlled airport, fog-prone conditions, major event congestion (May-June, Air Show)
- **Key Advantage:** 24/7 arrivals without slots; three runways for weather flexibility; no diplomatic clearance
- **Best For:** Daytime/early evening operations; European business hub access
- **Cost Profile:** MEDIUM-HIGH (noise-modulated landing fees)

### Tier 3: High Complexity with Structural Constraints
**EGGX (London Luton)**
- **Primary Challenges:** Single runway (crosswind vulnerability), severe night slot restrictions (Summer 2025: only 100 slots, QC ≤ 0.5), out-of-hours surcharges
- **Key Advantage:** No PPR required; multiple nearby alternates; straightforward UK regulatory environment
- **Best For:** Daytime London area operations; backup for congested London airports
- **Cost Profile:** MEDIUM (out-of-hours surcharges substantial)

## Seasonal Planning Guidelines

### Q1 (January-March) - Winter Operations
- **LFPB:** Fog risk moderate; night curfew in effect; manageable traffic
- **EGGX:** Winter weather low risk; daytime operations unconstrained
- **LSGG:** Alpine weather risk HIGH; CAT rating essential; consider alternates
- **Recommendation:** EGGX/LFPB preferable; LSGG requires weather contingency

### Q2 (April-June) - High Traffic Period
- **LFPB:** French Open (May-June) creates major congestion; advance planning CRITICAL
- **EGGX:** Growing traffic; summer slot restrictions approaching
- **LSGG:** EBACE exhibition (May); Geneva Motor Show (March) create peaks
- **Recommendation:** Book slots 30 days in advance; monitor events

### Q3 (July-September) - Constrained Operations
- **LFPB:** High summer traffic; continuing congestion; night departures limited
- **EGGX:** Severe night restrictions (Summer 2025); daytime ops unrestricted; main runway maintenance
- **LSGG:** Afternoon thunderstorms possible; noise restrictions active
- **Recommendation:** LFPB daytime ops preferred; EGGX daytime only; LSGG afternoon weather watch

### Q4 (October-December) - Stabilizing Traffic
- **LFPB:** Returning to normal operations; night curfew continues; fog risk increasing
- **EGGX:** Main runway resurfacing (Nov-Mar); night slot restrictions easing
- **LSGG:** Alpine weather increasing; winter preparation essential
- **Recommendation:** LFPB/EGGX feasible; LSGG winter contingency planning

## Recommendations for Subagent Parent

1. **Use LSGG data for Alpine/Winter operations planning** - comprehensive weather and capability data
2. **Use LFPB data for Paris/Central European hub access** - event-based congestion patterns important
3. **Use EGGX data for London area operations** - note single runway and night restriction constraints
4. **Cross-reference alternate airports** - Annemasse (13 km from Geneva), Stansted (45 km from London), Le Touquet (75 km from Paris)
5. **Seasonal planning critical** - Q2/Q3 (summer) requires 30+ day advance coordination for all three
