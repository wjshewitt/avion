## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### Operational Hours
| Airport | Hours | Curfew | Night Operations | Risk |
|---------|-------|--------|------------------|------|
| EHAM | 24/7 | 22:40-06:55 | Yes (slots required) | HIGH |
| LFMD | 06:00-19:00 | 19:30-05:30 | NO—PROHIBITED | HIGH |
| LEPA | 24/7 | None | Yes (24/7) | LOW |

**Winner:** LEPA (24/7 with no curfew)

### Weather Reliability
| Airport | Fog | Snow | Wind | Overall Reliability |
|---------|-----|------|------|-------------------|
| EHAM | Frequent | Occasional | Occasional | MODERATE |
| LFMD | Rare | Never | Rare | EXCELLENT |
| LEPA | Never | Never | Rare | EXCELLENT |

**Winner:** LEPA and LFMD (Mediterranean climate, nearly identical reliability)

### Congestion
| Airport | Typical Peak Delay | Seasonal Multiplier | Risk Level |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| EHAM | 15-30 min | 1.2x | EXTREME |
| LFMD | 5-15 min | 2.5x (Festival) | MEDIUM |
| LEPA | 10-25 min | 3.0x (Summer) | MEDIUM |

**Note:** EHAM's baseline congestion is highest; LFMD's multiplier driven by specific events; LEPA's driven by continuous summer tourism.

### Aircraft Restrictions
| Airport | Weight Limits | Size Constraints | Runway Capacity |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| EHAM | None specified | All accommodated | 6 runways (3.8 km max) |
| LFMD | 5.7 tons on RWY04/22 | <35 tons turbojets | 1.6 km primary |
| LEPA | None specified | All accommodated | 2 runways (3.3 km max) |

**Winner:** EHAM and LEPA (no restrictions)
