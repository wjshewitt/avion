**Applicable Regulation:** FAA Advisory Circular 120-76E (September 9, 2021)  
**Subject:** Authorization and Use of Electronic Flight Bags

**Avion Classification:**

Avion is primarily a **ground-based flight management tool**, but may be referenced as similar to a Type A EFB application when used for flight planning purposes — a non-installed software application that runs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware (tablets, laptops, smartphones).

**Important Distinction:**

- Avion is **NOT designed for cockpit/in-flight use** by pilots
- Avion is designed for **flight department personnel, dispatchers, and operations managers**
- Information from Avion should be **verified and communicated to pilots** through proper operational channels

**AC 120-76E Context for Flight Operations:**

1. **Training:** Flight operations staff using Avion should receive training on the platform's capabilities and limitations
2. **Procedures:** Establish procedures for how information from Avion is verified and communicated to flight crews
3. **Data Currency:** Operations managers are responsible for ensuring information quality before communicating to pilots
4. **Human Factors:** Avoid over-reliance on any single planning tool; cross-check with multiple authoritative sources

**Avion Intended Use:**

- ✅ Use Avion for **ground-based flight planning, scheduling, and operations management**
- ✅ **Verify all data** with official sources before communicating to pilots (Chart Supplement, NOTAMs, official briefings)
- ✅ Ensure pilots conduct **independent preflight review** of all information
- ✅ Maintain **proper operational communications** between dispatch and flight crew
- ❌ **DO NOT use Avion as cockpit application or for in-flight decision-making**

**Reference:** [AC 120-76E PDF](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_120-76E_FAA_Web.pdf)
