    "key_operational_considerations": "Palma is a high-volume tourist destination airport suitable for year-round operations. Critical advantage: 24/7 operations enable scheduling flexibility unavailable at many European airports. Weather is exceptionally reliable. Peak season (June-August) requires advance coordination—parking must be confirmed, slots pre-booked, and handling arranged minimum 15 days ahead. Off-season (November-April) offers smooth operations with minimal congestion. Ground handling is efficient and competitively priced. Landing permits for charter flights require 24-48 hours but are routinely granted. Excellent alternate airports nearby. Airport location on island increases alternate importance but alternatives are readily available."
