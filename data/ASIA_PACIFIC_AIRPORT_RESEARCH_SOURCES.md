## Cross-Reference Verification Methodology

### Data Validation Process
1. **Multiple Source Confirmation**: Each critical data point verified across 2+ independent sources
2. **Authority Hierarchy**: Prioritized official government sources over commercial sources
3. **Recency**: Used most recent available documents (2024-2025 emphasis)
4. **Conflict Resolution**: When sources conflicted (e.g., KOPF runway lengths), used official FAA/Wikipedia data as authoritative
5. **Regional Expertise**: Incorporated regional authority expertise (CAD for Hong Kong, MLIT for Japan, FAA/CBP for USA)

### Key Cross-Referenced Data Points

#### VHHH 24/7 Operations
- Confirmed across: CAD AIP (multiple 2025 versions), Universal Weather, AIS.gov.hk
- Reliability: **HIGHEST**

#### RJAA Night Ban Hours
- Confirmed across: Multiple sources cite 2300-0600 JST = 14:00-21:00 UTC
- Verified against: MLIT regulations, Narita Airport official site, multiple aviation guides
- Reliability: **HIGHEST**

#### KOPF Operating Hours & CBP Requirements
- Confirmed across: CBP official fact sheets, FAA documentation, multiple FBO guides
- Conflicting runway lengths resolved using FAA/Wikipedia authority
- Reliability: **HIGHEST**

## Data Freshness & Limitations

### Current Information Status
- **Research Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Latest Updates Referenced**:
  - Hong Kong AIP amendments through September 2025
  - Recent Narita disruptions (October 2025)
  - Hurricane Melissa impact (October 2025)
  - Fuel prices (September 2025)
  - Operating procedures current as of late 2025

### Known Data Gaps Addressed
1. **Exact Taxi Times**: Not officially published; estimated from congestion studies
2. **Specific Maintenance Schedules**: Not disclosed by airports; assumed zero planned closures
3. **Crew Hour Requirements**: RJAA data derived from JCAB standards and airline requirements
4. **Hurricane/Typhoon Frequency Metrics**: Based on historical seasonal patterns; exact annual averages not always available
5. **Alternate Airport Ground Transport**: Estimates based on typical travel times

### Limitations & Caveats
- KOPF runway length conflicts in various sources; resolved using official FAA/Wikipedia authority
- Some historical data (e.g., 2016 KOPF operations) used due to lack of current year data
- Weather vulnerability estimates based on seasonal patterns and meteorological data
- Congestion metrics based on available reports; real-time data subject to variation

## Conclusion

The airport risk assessment data has been collected from the most authoritative sources available for each jurisdiction:
- **Hong Kong**: Hong Kong CAD, AIP, Airport Authority (AAHK)
- **Japan**: MLIT, Narita International Airport Corporation, Japan Schedule Coordination
- **USA**: FAA, CBP, Miami-Dade Aviation Department

Cross-referencing across multiple sources ensures accuracy and reliability for operational decision-making.
