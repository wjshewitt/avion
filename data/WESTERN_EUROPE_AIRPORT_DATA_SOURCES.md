## Data Verification Methodology

1. **Multiple Source Verification**: Each risk factor cross-referenced across minimum 2-3 independent authoritative sources
2. **Regulatory Authority Consultation**: French DGAC, UK CAA, Swiss FOCA directly referenced
3. **Practical Operator Data**: FBO and ground handling provider information validated against official airport procedures
4. **Current Status Confirmation**: 2024-2025 operational data prioritized; outdated sources noted with dates
5. **Ambiguities Flagged**: Where sources diverged, most conservative/recent data selected and documented

---

## Notable Data Gaps & Research Limitations

1. **Specific Airport Fee Structures**: Detailed 2025 fee schedules not published by all airports; estimated from 2024 data and provider quotes
2. **Real-Time Taxi Time Data**: Historical averages used; real-time delays vary by time/season
3. **Infrastructure Failure Rates**: Limited historical data; reliant on airport claims of "low" rates
4. **Diplomatic Clearance Requirements**: Not formally required for any three airports; Swiss/French/UK standards assumed standard
5. **Seasonal Weather Statistics**: Some data extrapolated from general Alpine/UK weather patterns rather than airport-specific historical data

---

## Assessment Quality Notes

- **LFPB Data Confidence**: HIGH - Well-documented airport with extensive FBO support and published DGAC guidelines
- **EGGX Data Confidence**: HIGH - UK CAA regulations comprehensive; post-BREXIT clarity established
- **LSGG Data Confidence**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Swiss regulatory clarity good; limited English-language operational detail on some fees
- **Overall Assessment**: RELIABLE for strategic flight planning; recommend confirming specific fees and permits 24-48 hours before operations
