# Ideas

1. **Delegate model tool** – add a tool that spins up a fresh high-context model with its own toolset so the main chat agent can hand off complex reasoning or niche tool usage without bloating the primary context window.
2. **Intel-first retrieval layer** – introduce a lightweight retrieval/tooling layer (or full RAG later) so the assistant checks stored airport/operator intel before falling back to live web search.
