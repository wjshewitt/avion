      "EGGX": "No PPR required; multiple alternate airports within short distance; daytime operations unrestricted; straightforward regulatory environment",
      "LSGG": "Reliable weather handling (CAT IIIb capability); efficient operations; excellent backup (Annemasse 13 km); professional infrastructure; good alternate airports"
    },
    "critical_success_factors": {
      "advance_planning": "All three airports require 24+ hour advance coordination; LSGG requires 5 days for IFR",
      "cost_considerations": "LSGG mandatory handling (most expensive); EGGX out-of-hours surcharges; LFPB noise-modulated fees",
      "seasonal_planning": "LFPB: May-June events create congestion. EGGX: June-September night restrictions. LSGG: Alpine weather November-February.",
      "crew_documentation": "EU crews generally straightforward; non-Schengen crews require advance visa coordination for LFPB/LSGG"
